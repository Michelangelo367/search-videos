# YT Video Searcher

A python script for interacting with the Youtube API and searching for videos in different ways and with different filters.

## TODO

- [ ] Take input from user to set filter value
- [x] Create automatically the required folders
- [x] Do not overwrite the `videos.txt` file every time the program runs. Instead append videos at the end of the file.
- [ ] Make a second filter so the user can choose any playlist to filter videos from.
- [ ] Sort the `videos.txt` file with published date.
- [x] Make an `sqlite3.db` database to store the videos.
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) Create a Firebase Database so you have online and real time information.
